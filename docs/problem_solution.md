## 1. The Problem Statement

**"Finding reliable, safe, and quality home assistance in the MENA region is currently a fragmented, risky, and inefficient process."**

Despite the rapid modernization of lifestyle in cities like Cairo, Riyadh, and Dubai, the home services sector remains largely **informal** and **unregulated**.

### Key Challenges:
1.  **The Trust Deficit:** Households are hesitant to let strangers into their homes due to a lack of background checks.
2.  **Fragmented Market:** Finding a cleaner often relies on word-of-mouth or unverified classified ads, leading to inconsistent quality.
3.  **Informal Employment:** Millions of workers in the region work without contracts, facing income instability and exploitation.
4.  **Inefficiency:** Manual scheduling, cash-only payments, and lack of tracking create friction for both parties.
